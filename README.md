# API Tester exercise
This project contains a solution for API testing exercises with Rest Assured in JAVA, using https://petstore.swagger.io/

## Task 1 (Success/Fail branch testing)
Using the following project, write a test for each of the endpoints already implemented
to test the response to a successful or unsuccessful submission. Execute the checks you consider necessary.

## Task 2 (Test the Create,update,delete pet process.)
Create the necessary endpoint calls that are not yet implemented:
- Create a new ```/{petId}``` list item
- Modify this previously created item
- Then delete the modified item
- Check modification and deletion with GET ```/pet/{petId}``` endpoint
- Write checks on the endpoints response.

## Task 3 (Test suites)
From the existing tests you have created, create a **SMOKE** and a **REGRESSION** run set.
